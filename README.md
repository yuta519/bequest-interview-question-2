# Tamper Proof Data

At Bequest, we require that important user data is tamper proof. Otherwise, our system can incorrectly distribute assets if our internal database is breached. 
Only the user is able to update their own data. There are 2 parties that read the data, the user and our server.


**How does the client insure that the data has not been tampered with?**
<br />
**If the data has been tampered with, how can the client recover the lost data?**


Edit this repo to answer these two questions using any technology you'd like. Feel free to add comments.

### To run the apps:
```npm run start``` in both the frontend and backend

### Send an email to robert@bequest.finance with a link to the github repo solution. Best of luck!
